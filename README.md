This Python script demonstrates a simple implementation of spam email detection using the Naive Bayes classifier. The script utilizes the scikit-learn library and follows a basic machine learning pipeline. It uses a CountVectorizer for text representation and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for the actual spam classification.

Key Components:
1. Data Preparation:
   - The script uses a small sample dataset with labeled examples indicating whether an email is spam (1) or not spam (0).

2. Data Splitting:
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets to assess the model's performance.

3. Model Creation:
   - A machine learning pipeline is created, consisting of a CountVectorizer for converting text into numerical features and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.

4. Model Training:
   - The model is trained on the training set using the `fit` method.

5. User Interaction:
   - The script includes a simple function, `predict_spam_or_not`, allowing users to input email content and receive predictions on whether the input email is classified as spam or not.

Usage:
1. Replace the sample dataset with your own dataset, ensuring it has 'text' for email content and 'label' for the class (1 for spam, 0 for not spam).
2. Run the script to train the model and make predictions interactively.

Note:
This script serves as a basic example. For a more robust spam detection system, consider using larger and more diverse datasets, experimenting with different classifiers, and implementing additional preprocessing steps.

Feel free to modify and expand upon this script for your specific use case or integrate it into a larger project.
